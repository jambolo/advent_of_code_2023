# Advent Of Code 2023

My solutions for Advent of Code 2023 implemented in Rust

### Day 1

First introduction to Rust. My first impression is that the pervasive use of Option<> makes even the most trivial tasks, such as this one, very complicated.

### Day 2

Copilot is turning out to be relatively useful. It is pretty good at doing the boilerplate code and copy pasta. The boilerplate code is  especially helpful while Rust is new to me. I don't have to worry about all of the minute details.

### Day 3

Collections in Rust are pretty straightforward. Objects are still a bit of a mystery. 

### Day 4

Objects are still a mystery -- object vs. reference and move vs. copy. Rust and copilot are helpful, telling me how to fix the problems, but I suspect there are many times I am making copies of objects when I could just be using references.

### Day 5

Well, that escalated quickly! Part 1 was simple. Part 2 showed that it wasn't a scalable solution. Manipulating intervals is  interesting.
